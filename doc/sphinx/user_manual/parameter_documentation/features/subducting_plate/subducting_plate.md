Subducting plate
==========

The subducting plate feature provides the user with the ability to add a subducting slab to the GWB world. To define a slab, the user must specify the `coordinates` where the slab intersects with the surface of the world, which for a subducting plate represents the location of the trench. In the Cartesian coordinate system, `coordinates` are represented by `[x, y]` points (in meters), and in the spherical coordinate system `coordinates` are represented by `[longitude, latitude]` points (in degrees). Additionally, because the trench is simply a line on the surface, the user must also specify the direction that the subducting plate dips from the trench via the `dip point`. The dip point is also represented as a surface point ([x, y] in cartesian, [longitude, latitude] in spherical).

To create a slab that does not change along-strike, the user can simply specify a number of `segments`. Segments are defined through a `length`, a `thickness`, and an `angle`. When the `angle` and the `thickness` are input as single values and not as arrays, the resulting segment is defined by a straight line segment, and dips away from the trench towards the `dip point` at the specified `angle`, with a uniform `thickness`. However, the segment can vary in `thickness` if the user specifies `thickness` as an array of two values, in which case the segment will still be represented as a staight line segment, but will linearly vary from the first thickness to the second thickness across the `length` of the segment. If the user also inputs `angle` as an array of two values, the segment will be represented as a piece of a circle, where the dip of the segment varies linearly from the first angle to the second angle across the `length` of the segment. Any given segment can vary in `thickness` and in `angle`, and when multiple segments are defined the termination point of a given segment acts as the starting point of the following segment. Combining segments in this way enables a user to define extremely complicated slab geometries down-dip of the trench `coordinates`.

Additional complexity can be introduced by specifying `sections`, which allow the user to vary the shape of the slab along-strike of the trench. If the trench is defined by $N$ surface `coordinates`, then $N$ `sections` can be specified, where each `section` is mapped to the corresponding `coordinates` of the trench. The `sections` are made up of $M$ `segments` ($M$ does not need to be equal to $N$), thereby creating $N$ unique curves along-strike of the trench, and these `sections` are interpolated along strike using a Bezier interpolation to form a complex 3-dimensional slab that varies along-strike and down-dip.
