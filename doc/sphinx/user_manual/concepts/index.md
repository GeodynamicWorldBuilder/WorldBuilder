Important GWB Concepts
======================

To understand how to make a World Builder file that creates some interesting initial conditions, it is important to understand some of the concepts it is built upon. This chapter is dedicated to ensuring you understand these concepts. This is also important when looking into the source files since the code is built up around these concepts as well. So having a good understanding of these concepts will both make reading the rest of this manual as well as reading the code a lot easier.
