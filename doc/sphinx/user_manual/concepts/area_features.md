Area features
=============================

Looking at a map that illustrates geologic and tectonic features first will help you build GWB models. All features are named based on nomenclature typically used in the Earth sciences.
In {ref}`part:user_manual:chap:concepts:sec:painting_the_world`, we have already introduced you to the **area feature** which includes `oceanic plate`, `subducting plate` and `mantle layer` features. Another area feature is `continental plate`. We will explain how these features are implemented in practice in {ref}`part:user_manual:chap:basic_starter_tutorial:sec:index`.
