Area features
=============================

Since the idea that you should look at a map first when making GWB models, all features are named after what they would look like on a map. In {ref}`part:user_manual:chap:concepts:sec:painting_the_world` we were already introduced to the **area feature**. This is the `oceanic plate` feature we use there. Other examples of area features are the `continental plate` and `mantle layer` features. We will explain how they work in practice in the {ref}`part:user_manual:chap:basic_starter_tutorial:sec:index`.
