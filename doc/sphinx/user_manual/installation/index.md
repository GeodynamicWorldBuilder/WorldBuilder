Installation
============

The world builder currently officially supports Linux, OSX, and Windows operating systems.
Each change to the library is tested against these platforms.
The only requirements are a c++ compiler (tested both with GCC and clang) with at minimum c++14 installed together with CMake (<https://cmake.org>).

{ref}`part:user_manual:chap:installation:sec:included` will go in depth about what is in the Geodynamic World Builder package when it is downloaded and installed completely.
If you want to skip this explanation, go directly to {ref}`part:user_manual:chap:installation:sec:installing_prerequisites`.
