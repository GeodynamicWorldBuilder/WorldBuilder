Why would I need the GWB?
=========================

The idea behind the GWB is to make it easy to make parameterized complex and reproducible initial conditions for geodynamic models. A more extensive list of what the GWB is designed to do can be found in sections {ref}`part:introduction:chap:what_is_the_gwb` and {ref}`part:introduction:chap:gwb_philosophy`.

In short, if you want to easily build more complex geodynamic models then a few if and else statements can provide, either for modeling or visualizing, the GWB may be for you.
