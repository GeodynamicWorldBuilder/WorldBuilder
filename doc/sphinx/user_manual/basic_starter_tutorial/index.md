Basic Starter Tutorial
========================

This tutorial teaches you how to set up a World Builder file to build a simple but functional 2D and 3D model. The example subduction model (shown below) introduces you slowly, step-by-step to a wide range of features and explains how to use them. It is strongly recommended that you read the previous sections of the User manual and to follow this tutorial before tackling more advanced tutorials or cookbooks.
