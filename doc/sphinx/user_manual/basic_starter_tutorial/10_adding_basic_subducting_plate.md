Adding basic subducting plate
============================

Now that we have a solid enough understanding of how area features like `oceanic plate`, `continental plate` and `mantle layer` work, we can start to take a look at line features. In this case we are going to take a look at the `subducting plate`, but note that there is also the `fault`. On a fundementatl level, they both function in a very similar way, with the main difference being that the slab has a slab surface and a down direction, while the fault has a center surface and is symmetric on both sides. The temperature an compositional models available for each also may differ.
