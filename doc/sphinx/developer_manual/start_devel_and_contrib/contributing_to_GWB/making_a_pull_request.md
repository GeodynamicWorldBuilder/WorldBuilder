Making a pull request
=====================

To contribute to the GWB, follow these steps:
- Create a fork (through GitHub) of the code base.
- Create a separate branch (sometimes called a feature branch) on which you do your modifications.
- Open a pull request for your branch to propose merging your branch into the GWB code. By doing this, you invite others to review your changes and approve them to be merged into the main branch.
- During the review, you can respond to comments by adding more commits by pushing to your branch. Your changes will be automatically updated on the pull request page.
