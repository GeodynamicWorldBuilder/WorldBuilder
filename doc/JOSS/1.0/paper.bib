abstract = {Abstract Creating the initial geometry and temperature configuration of 3-D numerical simulations is a challenging task. Professional tools are expensive. They often have a steep learning curve and do mostly not interface with the numerical simulation software used by the geodynamics and tectonics academic community. There, we developed geometry Input/Output (geomIO), a MATLAB toolbox to create the initial configuration of geological models regarding model geometry and temperature structure. geomIO allows users to create a geo-referenced 3-D volume by drawing multiple 2-D cross sections in a standard vector graphics editor. The volume is then used to assign material properties and set up initial temperature distribution on a set of vertices. In 2-D mode, polygons can also be used to create a triangular mesh. In addition to the standard functionality, the gravity anomaly of any geometry created with geomIO can be calculated. In this paper, we give an overview of the basic functionalities of geomIO. We illustrate the strength of our software with advanced tectonic and geodynamic applications that could not have been performed with currently available free software. Applications include the Himalayan orogen, the Japanese subduction zones, present-day salt diapirs, and small-scale tectonic structures. We describe algorithms and file formats in the supporting information. The toolbox is user-friendly and flexible. Users can use custom pipelines or preset data processing pipelines, so most applications require only a few lines of code. geomIO is distributed under the GNU General Public License and includes an online wiki with tutorials and additional examples.},

abstract = {Abstract Geodynamic codes have become fast and efficient enough to facilitate sensitivity analysis of rheological parameters. With sufficient data, they can even be inverted for. Yet, the geodynamic inverse problem is often regularized by assuming a constant geometry of the geological setting (e.g., shape, location and size of salt diapirs or magma bodies) or approximating irregular bodies with simple shapes like boxes, spheres or ellipsoids to reduce the parameter space. Here, we present a simple and intuitive method to parameterize complex 3D bodies and incorporate them into geodynamic inverse problems. The approach can automatically create an entire ensemble of initial geometries, enabling us to account for uncertainties in imaging data. Furthermore, it allows us to investigate the sensitivity of the model results to geometrical properties and facilitates inverting for them. We demonstrate the method with two examples. A salt diapir in an extending regime and free subduction of an oceanic plate under a continent. In both cases, small differences in the model's initial geometry lead to vastly different results. Be it the formation of faults or the velocity of plates. Using the salt diapir example, we demonstrate that, given an additional geophysical observation, we are able to invert for uncertain geometric properties. This highlights that geodynamic studies should investigate the sensitivity of their models to the initial geometry and include it in their inversion framework. We make our method available as part of the open-source software geomIO.},
