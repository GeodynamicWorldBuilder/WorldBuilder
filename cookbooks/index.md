Cookbooks
======================

This section contains self-contained cookbooks on how to design different geodynamic setups. Cookbook folders contain World Builder parameter files, grid output files, and optionally a documentation folder called `doc`. The documentation folder contains markdown files and figures, which are incorporated into the online documentation and explain particular features about the cookbook.
