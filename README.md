# The Geodynamic World Builder (GWB)
## What is the Geodynamic World Builder?
The Geodynamic World Builder(GWB) is an open source code library intended to set up initial conditions for computational geodynamic models and/or visualize complex 3d teconic setting, in both Cartesian and Spherical geometries. The inputs for the JSON-style parameter file are not mathematical, but rather a structured nested list describing tectonic features, e.g. a continental, an oceanic or a subducting plate. Each of these tectonic features can be assigned a specific temperature profile (e.g. plate model) or composition label (e.g. uniform). For each point in space, the GWB can return the composition and/or temperature. It is written in C++, but can be used in almost any language through its C and Fortran wrappers. Various examples of 2D and 3D subduction settings are presented.

For more information see the the [GWB site](https://geodynamicworldbuilder.github.io/), see the automatically generated extensive [online User Manual](https://gwb.mfraters.net/manual/manual.pdf) or the automatically generated [code documentation](https://codedocs.xyz/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/index.html).

## What do I do when I have a question or want to request a feature?
If you have a question about the code and you can not find the answer easily in the documentation or the question is already raised as an [issue](https://github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues), please let us know by opening an [issue on github](https://github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/new). This is also the preferred method for asking for new features for GWB.

## I found a mistake in the documentation or code, what should I do?
Please do not keep it to yourself and let us know. Others will also profit from mistakes being found and fixed. Even if it is just a typo in the documentation feel free to raise an issue or, even better, make a pull request to fix the issue.

## How to cite?
The developers of the Geodynamic World Builder request that you cite the following publication:

Fraters, M., Thieulot, C., van den Berg, A., and Spakman, W.: The Geodynamic World Builder: a solution for complex initial conditions in numerical modelling, Solid Earth, [https://doi.org/10.5194/se-10-1785-2019](https://doi.org/10.5194/se-10-1785-2019), 2019.

And cite the specific version of the software used. Version 0.3.0 can be cited as:

Menno Fraters and others. 2019, October 23. The Geodynamic World Builder v0.3.0. Zenodo. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3900603](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3900603).
