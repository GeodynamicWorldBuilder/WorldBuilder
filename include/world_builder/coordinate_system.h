   * There are three ways to look at what should happen when the user gives an
   * angle to go down in a sphere. The first one is the easiest, which is just
   * to tread the system as a Cartesian system. This means taking the angle
   * with the surface tangential at the starting point at the surface
   * everywhere. The advantage is that it is very intuitive and easy to
   * predict what geometry should be produced. This option is called
   * 'angle_at_starting_point_with_surface'. The other end member is that
   * going down with an angle in a sphere should mean that it always goes down
   * with a constant angle relative to the surface tangential at that
   * longitude and latitude. This means a the geometry would a a logarithmic
   * spiral. This option is called 'continuous_angle_with_surface'. Because it
   * is currently to time consuming to implement this option with all the
   * required features, there is an option which approximates this behavior,
   * by using the option 'angle_at_starting_point_with_surface'. This option
   * uses the surface tangential at the beginning of every segment. This means
   * that in the limit of segments going to length zero, this option produces
   * exactly the same geometry as 'continuous_angle_with_surface'.
