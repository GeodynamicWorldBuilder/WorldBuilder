         * This class represents a subducting plate temperature model. The temperature
         * model uses the heat content (proportional to to thermal mass anomaly) to
         * define a smooth temperature profile that conserves mass along the slab length.
         * An empirical (linear) model is used to define how the minimum temperature
         * increases with depth and how the location of the minimum temperature shifts
         * into the slab interior. The slab is divided in to top and bottom parts,
         * which meet at the location where the minimum temperature occurs in the slab.
         * For the bottom slab the temperature is defined by a half-space cooling model.
         * For the top of the slab the temperature is defined by one side of a 1D infinite
         * space cooling model. The age of the overriding plate is used so the slab temperature
         * at shallow depth smoothly transitions to the temperature of the overriding plate:
         * this is not perfect, and is affected by the value of "top truncation" parameter
         * subducting plate. Also note that the parameter "thickness" for the subducting plate_velocity
         * needs to be defined but is not used.
