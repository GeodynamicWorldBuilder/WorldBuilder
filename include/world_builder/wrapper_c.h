/**
 * @brief This function returns 2D properties.
 *
 * The properties input decides what each entry means, and the output is generated in the
 * same order as the properties input. The properties input consists of
 * a 3D array, where the first entry identifies the property and the last two entries
 * provide extra information about that property.
 *
 * Temperature is identified by 1 and no extra information is needed. So temperature
 * input usually looks like {1,0,0}. A temperature query prodoces one entry in the output
 * vector.
 *
 * Composition is identified by 2. This produces one
 * value in the output. The second entry  identifies the composition number and the third
 * number is not used. So a composition query asking about composition 1 looks like this:
 * {2,1,0}. A composition query prodoces one entry in the output vector.
 *
 * Grains are identified by 3. The second entry is the grain composition number and the third
 * entry is the number of grains. A query about the grains, where it asks about composition 1
 * (for example enstatite) and 500 grains, looks like this: {3,1,500}.
 * A composition query prodoces n_grains*10 entries in the output vector. The first n_grains
 * entries are the sizes of all the grains, and the other 9 entries are sets of rotation
 * matrices. The rotation matrix entries are ordered [0][0],[0][1],[0][2],[1][0],[1][1],etc.
 *
 * The tag is identified by 4 and no extra information is needed. So the tag
 * input usually looks like {4,0,0}. A tag query prodoces one entry in the output
 * vector, representing the index of the tag of the last/dominant feature.
 *
 * @param ptr_ptr_world a pointer to the world
 * @param x The x position of the point
 * @param z The z position of the point
 * @param depth The depth of the point
