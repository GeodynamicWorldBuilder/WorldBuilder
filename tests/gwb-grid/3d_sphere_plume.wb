// This is a test for the plume feature in spherical geometry.
// It checks if the plume has the right geometry in terms of its temperature
// and composition, which are uniform within the plume, with the composition
// having two layers.
// Specifically, the plume changes the location of its center axis going in a
// clockwise circle a bit more than half way on the way down and it
// increases in radius with depth. Its cross section is slightly elongated in
// the same direction the center axis is curved, but the eccentricity stays
// the same.
