# Contributing to the Geodynamic World Builder

The Geodynamic World Builder is a community project that lives by the participation of its
members â€” i.e., including you! It is our goal to build an inclusive
and participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating!

We describe the process of contributing to the Geodynamic World Builder in
our online documentation at:
