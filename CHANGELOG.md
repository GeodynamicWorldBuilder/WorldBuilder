## [0.4.0]
### Added
- Added basic unity build. \[Menno Fraters; 2020-08-15; [#206](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/206)\]
- Allow to chose interpolation type per feature. \[Menno Fraters; 2021-04-23; [#224](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/224)\]
- Added a benchmarks and let them automatically run by the github actions. A summary of the results are automatically posted on the github pages.  \[Menno Fraters; 2021-05-22; [#238](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/238)\]
- Added an option to not build the unit tests.  \[Menno Fraters; 2021-05-22; [#238](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/238)\]
- Added an option for Continuous Monotone Spline interpolation. This is useful for faults and slabs which need to be continuous and smooth. \[Menno Fraters; 2021-05-24; [#130](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/130),[#237](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/pull/237)\]

### Changed
- Change minimum chame version fom 2.8.12 to 2.8.13. \[Menno Fraters; 2020-11-16; [#215](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/215)\]
- Change minimum xcode version to 11. \[Menno Fraters; 2020-12-10; [#217](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/217)\]
- Change changelog style to markdown based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). \[Menno Fraters; 2021-05-01; [#230](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/230),[#231](https://github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/pull/231)\]
- Changed the underlying function which determines when you are inside a slab or a fault. This may slightly change the result, but the new result is more realistic I think. \[Menno Fraters; 2021-05-01; [#229](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/229)\]
- The Vizualizer now uses compressed output by default. This decreases the file size and increases perforamnce. \[Menno Fraters; 2021-05-22; [#239](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/239)\]
- The Vizualizer buffers output before it writes it to a file. This increases performance. \[Menno Fraters; 2021-05-22; [#239](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/239)\]
- In the fault temperature model linear, the entiry top temperature is changed to center temperature and the entry bottom temperature is changed to side temperature, since this represents the actual sides more accurately. \[Menno Fraters; 2021-07-09; [#260](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/260)\]
- A large overhoal of the distance_point_from_curved_planes function improving the accuracy in spherical coordinates. This may slighty change the results, but it should be an improvement both in accuracy and performance. Also makes available a coordinate system independent distrance function and some fast trigonometric functions. \[Menno Fraters; 2021-06-11; [#255](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/255)\]

### Fixed
- Fixed namespaces, adding `WorldBuilder::` where needed. \[Timo Heister; 2020-08-10; [#205](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/issues/205)\] 
- Fixed bug in linear temperature models in several features when using a top/center temperature which computes the background (-1). \[Menno Fraters; 2021-06-22; [#273](github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/pull/273)\] 

## [0.3.0] - 2020-06-19
### Added
- An experimental grains interface containing grain sizes and orientations has been added. [Menno Fraters;;]
### Changed
- Fortran compiler is now optional [Menno Fraters;;]
- The world builder no longer requires or uses OpenMP. It was not used in the core  library, but used to speed up the Visualization program. That uses its own threads now. [Menno Fraters;;] 
- The usage of cmake has been moderized allowing for more flexibility [Menno Fraters;;]
### Fixed
- The code has been refactored and cleaned exstinively and new compiler warnings have been  enabled and fixed. [Menno Fraters;;]
