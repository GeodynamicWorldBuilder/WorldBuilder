This is a C example, showing how to use the C wrapper for the World builder. Assuming that the world builder is compiled in a directly called build, it can be compiled in this folder with: gcc example.c  -L../../build/lib/ -Wl,--whole-archive -lWorldBuilder -Wl,--no-whole-archive -lstdc++ -I../../include/ -lm for linux and windows and gcc example.c -L../../build/lib/ -Wl,-force_load,../../lib/libWorldBuilder.a -lc++ -lm  for OSX. There is also a CMakeList.txt in this direction, so you can also use the commands cmake . and make to compile the program.
