This is a fortran example, showing how to use the fortran wrapper for the World builder. Assuming that the world builder is compiled in a directly called build, it can be compiled in this folder with: gfortran example.f90 -L../../build/lib/ -Wl,--whole-archive -lWorldBuilder -Wl,--no-whole-archive -lstdc++ -I../../build/mod/ for linux and windows and gfortran example.f90 -L../../build/lib/ -Wl,-force_load,../../lib/libWorldBuilder.a -lc++ -I../../build/mod/   for OSX.
